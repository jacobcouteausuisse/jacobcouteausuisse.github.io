## Hey there!
I'm Jacob, from Qu√©bec. Where I come from, we say *Un vrai couteau Suisse*, which mean *A true Swiss knife*, to say that a person is variously skilled and surprises you with unexplained or uncommon knowledge. My girlfriend calls me *couteau suisse*, hence the name of the blog.

## History
Since I was a child, I was always interested in electronics. My grandfather, being an electronics teacher, helped me a lot to learn the basics of circuitry and electricity rules. During my teenage years, I discovered web development, and have since built multiple website projects. Before the end of High School, I had built from scratch an e-commerce portfolio to sell digital photographs with a custom CMS and a custom PayPal integration. I was also built and maintained a Cydia Repository for jailbroken iOS devices, iCauseFX. After that, I studied Computer Sciences as well as Electronics & Telecommunications, where I learned the *logical and academic* programing, CAD Design, Networking and Wireless protocols.

Wanting a clean slate to experiment minimal UI and new web paradigms, I set sail to rebuild my portfolio website, this time using Jekyll, GitHub Pages, Stripe and Snipcart. In its fifth year, the project has gone through many iterationa. In its current form, Stripe and Snipcart has been put aside. The whole UI is very minimal and soft to the eyes, putting the emphasis on the photographs and the various contexts and thoughts added.

## Beyond Innovations
Having a big sensitivity to climate change, sustainable developments and renewable energy, a friend and I started a to build recycled and recyclable domestic-sized wind turbines. We are currently building weather stations to gather data and help finance the project. Subscribe to stay tuned, at [beyondinnovations.tech](https://beyondinnovations.tech).


## Asteroid Labs
Following Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies since 2011, when I help to kickstart the Bitcoin Embassy in Montr√©al, I am now building a revolutionary project in this field. Started from the lack of adequate tools and scatered services, we are porting Financial tools to cryptos, porting multiple projects under one banner with single login and drasticaly reducing fees.
